## About
Developed in a group a small 3D rendering program that uses raycasting to build a walkable environment from a customizable map, applied algebra and trigonometry in a DDA algorithm to correctly diplay the environment, learned about RGB and hexadecimal color representation, all while handling dynamically allocated memory.

## Usage
Make will create the executable, to launch the program simple use "./cub3d <path_of_the_map>". U can create your own map in the same format of the example.
